# Mortal Kombat II (DOS) — timing investigation log and handoff

**Project:** DOSBox Staging research fork, `WildGer/dosbox-staging`
**Branch:** `mk2-timing-research`
**Working platform:** Windows 11, Visual Studio 2026 (CMake `release-windows` preset), ClangCL, vcpkg at `C:\vcpkg`
**Research date:** 2026-11-09
**Game:** GOG installation of *Mortal Kombat II*, launched as an external DOS .EXE.
**Status:** Instrumentation through register and video-write tracing was successfully used to generate CSV captures. New **boundary memory-state** (`_scanmem.csv`) probe added to the branch after the latest CSVs; **requires Windows build/runtime validation**.

## Scope and non-negotiable constraints

The goal is to understand the **source of inconsistent visual frame pacing in the DOS version of MK2**, preserving original simulation, timing, input and gameplay behavior while avoiding unnecessary resource usage. FPS numbers alone are not adequate: distinguish logic ticks, guest VRAM writes, VGA scanout, new visual images and host presentation.

- Research only, opt-in using `DOSBOX_MK2_TRACE`. Do **not** change the guest EXE, PIT divisor, IRQ0 schedule, VGA clocks or CPU-cycle rate to improve a graph without isolating the root cause.
- No copyrighted game executable or assets are part of the fork. The user owns a legitimate installation. Keep source files and CSV datasets separate from any commercial game contents.
- The work branch is based on DOSBox Staging development code, not an older release. Changes are experimental and must not alter behavior when tracing is off.
- The observed `*_frames.csv` reports changes in the **source image constructed by DOSBox**, not physical GPU presentation, and `changed=1` is **not** equivalent to a simulation tick or a fighter animation frame.
- Expect nonzero overhead from memory hashing, event logging and CSV output. Always compare a trace-enabled run with a control run when performance is in doubt.

## Reproducible launch configuration

The existing PowerShell launch script was used to run:

- DOSBox: `C:\Users\Usuario\Documents\dosbox-staging\build\release-windows\Release\dosbox.exe`
- Game: `D:\GoG\Mortal Kombat 2\mk2\mk2.exe`
- Example flags: `--nolocalconf --noautoexec --set cpu_cycles_protected=40000 --set presentation_mode=dos-rate --set vsync=off`, followed by the guest EXE path.
- Trace directory: `C:\Users\Usuario\Documents\MK2Timing`.
- The launch script supplies `DOSBOX_MK2_TRACE` pointing at `mk2_<cycles>_<timestamp>.csv`.
- Run with protected-mode CPU cycles of 20,000, 40,000 and 80,000; leave screen mode, game scene, presentation, audio and host configuration the same when comparing.
- The launcher is a **local user script**, not currently a tracked repository artifact. If it is lost, reconstruct the command from the lines above and the instructions in [mk2-timing-research.md](mk2-timing-research.md).

Build from repository:

```powershell
cd "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\dosbox-staging"
git switch mk2-timing-research
git pull --ff-only
$env:VCPKG_ROOT = "C:\vcpkg"
cmake --preset=release-windows
cmake --build --preset=release-windows --parallel 8
```

If CMake has already been configured with this preset, the build step alone is sufficient.

## Instrumentation inventory

All filenames share the launch's `DOSBOX_MK2_TRACE` prefix:

| File suffix | Purpose | Source hooks |
|---|---|---|
| `.csv` | PIT0 events/programming, IRQ0 delivery, VGA vertical refresh, 3DAh polls, host/emulated second windows | `hardware/timer.cpp`, `hardware/pic.cpp`, `hardware/video/vga_misc.cpp`, `hardware/video/vga_draw.cpp`, `hardware/mk2_timing_probe.h` |
| `_frames.csv` | Per-completed-scanout RGB-equivalent image hash, repeated images, real/emulated intervals, 8×5 regional change mask | `gui/render/mk2_frame_probe.h`, `gui/render/render.cpp` |
| `_vram.csv` | VGA memory-page-handler write-operation bursts aggregated by **1 ms emulated**, plus IRQ0, VGA and completion timestamps and handler coverage | `hardware/video/vga_memory.cpp`, `hardware/mk2_vram_probe.h` |
| `_regs.csv` | Individual CRTC start-address programming/latching, horizontal panning programming/latching, DAC colour commits and refresh/scanout state | `hardware/video/vga_crtc.cpp`, `hardware/video/vga_attr.cpp`, `hardware/video/vga_dac.cpp`, `hardware/video/vga_draw.cpp`, `hardware/mk2_vga_regs_probe.h` |
| **`_scanmem.csv`** | **New, not yet runtime validated.** At beginning/end of a scanout, hash raw backing VGA memory, its fastmem cache and the effective RGB palette; cross-reference the existing finished source-image hash | `hardware/mk2_scanmem_probe.h`, `hardware/video/vga_draw.cpp`, `gui/render/render.cpp` |

`_frames.csv` has a sequential scanout index. `_regs.csv` timestamps are fractional PIC-emulated milliseconds; `_vram.csv` buckets are **coarser** (1 ms) and cannot timestamp each individual CPU store exactly.

### Data captured locally (NOT committed into Git)

The project conversation had the following user-supplied CSV captures; do not imply that they exist in the Git repository.

| CPU cycles | File prefix | Probe coverage |
|---|---|---|
| 40,000 | `mk2_40000_20261109_191929` | PIT/VGA (earlier baseline) |
| 40,000 | `mk2_40000_20261109_200416` | PIT/VGA and frame-level visual changes |
| 20,000 | `mk2_20000_20261109_202724` | PIT/VGA and frames |
| 80,000 | `mk2_80000_20261109_202857` | PIT/VGA and frames |
| 40,000 | `mk2_40000_20261109_204156` | PIT/VGA, frames + 8×5 region grid |
| 40,000 | `mk2_40000_20261109_214037` | PIT/VGA, frames + regions, VRAM write counters |
| 40,000 | `mk2_40000_20261109_220957` | PIT/VGA, frames + regions, VRAM, VGA register timeline |

A future researcher should ask for these files again if necessary. All files are private experimental data; *do not claim to possess them in Git*. Each prefix denotes its own session, often with different fight/menu durations, so do not align different sessions by absolute emulated time.

## Results: directly verified from the supplied CSVs

### Timers

- The DOS version of MK2 **reprograms PIT channel 0 to divisor 19869**, approximately **60.052 Hz**, following an initial ~18.2 Hz period in DOS.
- VGA refreshing is approximately **70.09 Hz** (one emulated scanout about **14.268 ms**); IRQ0 and VGA are independent clocks.
- The frequency ratio is close to **6 IRQ periods : 7 VGA periods** over ~99.9 ms. That is a mathematical relationship, **not proof** of a particular MK2 game-loop design or actual logic-frame count.
- The overall emulated vs host-time windows were stable in the prior 40,000-cycle trace, but that does not eliminate individual host frame spikes.

### The 3–1–1–2 visual change pattern

- Many sequences of distinct **source images** were observed at intervals of **3, 1, 1, 2 VGA refreshes**, i.e. about **42.8 / 14.27 / 14.27 / 28.54 ms**. Four changes are distributed over seven refreshes (~100 ms), roughly **40 visibly different images per second** in those windows.
- The pattern was observed in the **20k, 40k, and 80k CPU-cycle tests**. This makes a pure CPU-starvation explanation less likely, but the fights were not frame-perfect repetitions, so it does **not** prove all scenes perform equally across cycles.
- Some other windows exceed 50 distinct source-image changes per emulated second. Thus **40 fps is not a global fixed MK2 visual-frame cap**.
- Even a source-image change is not necessarily a fighter frame; it can be HUD, background, partial scanout or colour animation.

### Regional 8×5 visual changes

- The 320×200 display is divided into 40 cells (8 columns × 5 rows), each roughly 40×40 pixels.
- Different steps of the recurring 3–1–1–2 cycle often affect **different parts of the image**, not the entire screen. This supports investigating asynchronously changing parts of the display, but the region grid alone cannot separate drawing, palette animation, scanline race or simulation.
- The frame probe's `pixel_format` for mode 320×200 was `32` in the collected samples (the **source as exposed to this renderer is already 32-bit BGRX**, although guest VGA uses indexed colours). Consequently, `pixels_changed` can reflect both changes of guest indices and palette-dependent RGB output.

### VRAM write bursts

- In the 40k sample `20261109_214037`, the VGA handler intercepted millions of guest memory-write operations, strongly clustered into bursts; some bursts followed IRQ0 by a small emulated interval.
- At least some irregular cadence exists in **VRAM write activity before the completed image is presented**. Hence changing the output refresh alone should not be assumed a complete fix.
- **Crucial caveat:** The counter counts callbacks via VGA page handlers. Certain direct-mapped memory accesses bypass those callbacks. Even `page_handler_covered=1` does not prove every possible write to video memory was captured.
- A write is not proof that a visible pixel changed; writes can repeat the same values, target offscreen memory, or finish before the scanout samples them.
- Any apparent mismatch between VRAM writes and changed images is an *unresolved observation*, not proof of a defect.

### CRTC / panning / palette (verified against 20261109_220957)

The `20261109_220957` session contains:

- **8,055** completed source scanouts and **3,030** distinct source images over roughly **115 seconds**.
- In 320×200 mode, **7,601** completed scanouts with **2,998** `changed=1` rows.
- The `_regs.csv` contains **50,227** register/refresh/scanout events, including **17,921** `dac_rgb_commit`, **12** `crtc_start_write`, and **3** `pel_pan_write` events across the full session.
- In a typical graphics interval 30,000–110,000 emulated ms, no new `crtc_start_write` or `pel_pan_write` events occurred. The refresh/scanout snapshots show programmed/latched **display start = 0** and **panning = 0**. That rules out *these particular register changes* as an explanation during that interval, not all display-addressing effects.
- There is substantial DAC activity, including repeated changes in certain high palette indices. Prior exploratory correlation noted DAC changes repeating at ~99.876 ms (seven VGA refreshes); this exact cadence should be re-validated by script if important to a proposed fix.

**Unexplained image changes:** Re-evaluating this same capture's 2,997 changed 320×200 frames with a simple *previous-to-current complete-scanout* interval join gives the following approximate classification:

| Observed VGA handler writes in interval | DAC entry commits in interval | Changed source images |
|---|---|---:|
| yes | yes | 977 |
| yes | no | 914 |
| no | yes | 357 |
| **no** | **no** | **749** |

These classifications are **approximate**: VRAM writes are aggregated at 1 ms boundaries, while DAC events and completed frames are sub-ms. An earlier in-chat analysis with slightly different bucket boundaries reported **748** cases with neither recorded event. The one-frame difference underscores the boundary ambiguity. Do not label these cases as impossible changes: buffering between scanlines, incomplete write coverage, other VGA state or persistence of earlier draws could explain them.

## New experiment: scanout memory-boundary fingerprinting

A new opt-in `*_scanmem.csv` file has been implemented on the branch. **Not yet validated on Windows.**

For each successful frame scanout, it:

1. Samples at **the start of the scheduled scanline work**, after the VGA draw-source pointer is selected.
2. Samples again at **the completed, non-aborted scanout**.
3. Hashes the **raw VGA memory backing store** (`vga.mem.linear`, up to 256 KiB), the **fast rendering memory cache** (`vga.fastmem`, up to 128 KiB), and **the effective VGA DAC palette** (`vga.dac.palette_map`, every colour in 24-bit RGB).
4. References the **already computed source-image hash** from `*_frames.csv` rather than recalculating the rendered-image hash.
5. Records changes **during the scanout** (start to end) and **between adjacent scanouts** (previous end to current start), including mode, draw-source kind, active display-start/panning, and byte-coverage fields.
6. Skips aborted frames and synthetic pause-time repaints; it has zero CSV output unless the same environment variable enables tracing.

Fields include `raw_changed_during`, `fast_changed_during`,
`palette_changed_during`, `raw_changed_between`,
`fast_changed_between`, `palette_changed_between`, the scanout index
and `visible_image_hash`.

**Important limitations:**

- These are **two whole-memory fingerprints per scanout**, not a video-frame capture at every scanline. If memory changes and changes back between samples, a hash will not reveal the transient modification. A hash may change due to offscreen writes.
- The raw and fastmem caps may miss display data in higher SVGA banks. Check `begin_raw_bytes`, `begin_fast_bytes`, `begin_source_kind` and VGA mode. The raw/fast storage is not equivalent to the final source image in 32-bit colour.
- `vga.fastmem` can be the selected renderer source in some modes; comparing only `vga.mem.linear` would be insufficient.
- The effective palette hash detects *palette state*, not whether a changed DAC entry was actually used in the image. The existing per-source-frame hash answers the visual question.
- This sampling incurs read-only memory bandwidth and computation in the trace-enabled code path. Keep the no-trace control.
- A changed completed source image with unchanged boundary hashes is **not yet proof** of a mixed old/new scanout: writes may be unobserved, transient, or performed outside the sampled span. Do not patch clocks based on that fact alone.

### How to analyze the next run

1. Compile branch `mk2-timing-research` with the command above. A compile-only check has **not** yet been completed for the new probe.
2. Start a 40,000-cycle run and collect ~60–90 seconds of gameplay, including moving fighters and a short static interval.
3. Collect **all five CSVs**: base `.csv`, `_frames.csv`, `_vram.csv`, `_regs.csv`, and **`_scanmem.csv`**.
4. Verify that `_scanmem.csv` is nonempty, `scanout_index` matches `_frames.csv`, and `visible_image_hash` agrees with `visible_hash` after joining.
5. For changed 320×200 images with no observed VRAM writes or DAC commits, categorize by `raw_changed_during`, `fast_changed_during`, `palette_changed_during`, plus their `*_between` flags.
6. Check changes occurring in the same scanout interval against `region_mask`, `crtc_start_write`, `start_latch`, `pan_latch` and palette events.
7. If no clear cause emerges, consider **per-scanline** timestamped state sampling in a narrowly scoped subset of frames rather than globally increasing logging volume.
8. Only after attributing changes should the experiment evaluate possible timing modifications. Preserve gameplay logic, input responsiveness and original animation pacing.

## Context to restore in a new chat

> We are working on private research into DOSBox Staging's Mortal Kombat II DOS frame pacing. Repo: `WildGer/dosbox-staging`, branch `mk2-timing-research`. We instrumented PIT0, IRQ0, VGA 3DAh and refresh, source-frame hashes and 8×5 changed regions, VGA memory page-handler writes, CRTC 0C/0D start address, panning, DAC colour commits and latches. MK2 PIT0 is ~60.052 Hz (divisor 19869), VGA ~70.09 Hz; a reproducible distinct-source-frame interval pattern 3-1-1-2 VGA refreshes occurs at 20k/40k/80k CPU cycles. Graphics-mode CRTC display start and panning remained zero in a 2026-11-09 sample; DAC palette cycling and VRAM write bursts exist. ~749 changed source images in that sample did not align with a write or DAC commit in the preceding coarse interval, but coverage/timestamp limitations prevent attributing a root cause. A new `_scanmem.csv` trace now samples raw VGA RAM, fastmem and effective DAC palette at scanout start/end to test whether memory or palette changes during/between scanouts; it is **not yet Windows-built or runtime-validated**. Please first review the actual branch and this findings document, then build/test/analyze the next five-CSV capture. We have not modified the original MK2 game assets or timing.

**Do not assume the source CSVs are in the repository.** If necessary, upload the five CSVs again. Maintain this document when new evidence changes a hypothesis.
